	<h1>A personal love letter to the most beautiful girl in the world!</h1>

	<p><b>Dear Martha,</b></p>
	<p>I love you more than a man can love anything in the whole world.</p>
	<p>I find it hard to express in words how much I love you so I made you this website.</p>
	<p>It might not be much, but this is how much effort I am willing to put in to show how much I love you!</p>
	<p>I will never let anything bad happen to you Martha and I will do anything I can in the world to ensure that we live a wonderful life together.</p>
	<p>I will always love you no matter what and I will always care for you.</p>
	<p>Thank you for being the most wonderful girlfriend around I will never take anything you do for me for granted.</p>
	<p>With an immense amount of love and affection,</p>
	<p>Thomas Louis Sinclair Jr. III</p>
